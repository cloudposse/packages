  Cloud Posse distribution of awesome apps.

introduction: |-

  Use this repo to easily install releases of popular Open Source apps. We provide a few ways to use it.
  
  1. **Make Based Installer.** This installer works regardless of your OS and distribution. It downloads packages directly from their GitHub source repos and installs them to your `INSTALL_PATH`. 
  2. **Alpine Linux Packages.** Use our Alpine repository to install prebuilt packages that use the original source binary (where possible) from the maintainers' official GitHub repo releases.
  3. **Docker Image.** Use our docker image as a base-image or as part of a multi-stage docker build. The docker image always distributes the latest linux binaries for `x86_64` architectures.

  See examples below for usage.

  **Is one of our packages out of date?**
  
  Open up an [issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages/issues) or submit a PR (*preferred*). We'll review quickly!

  ### Alpine Repository (recommended)
  
  A public Alpine repository is provided by [Cloud Posse](https://cloudposse.com). The repository is hosted on Amazon S3 and fronted by [CloudFlare's CDN](http://cloudflare.com) with end-to-end TLS. This ensures insane availability with DDoS mitigation and low-cost hosting. Using this alpine repository is ultimately more reliable than depending on [GitHub for availability](https://twitter.com/githubstatus) and provides an easier way to manage dependencies pinned at multiple versions. 
  
  The repository itself is managed using [`alpinist`](https://github.com/cloudposse/alpinist), which takes care of the heavy lifting of building repository indexes. You can self-host your own Alpine repository using this strategy.
  
  ### Configure the alpine repository:

  #### The Easy Way

  We provide a bootstrap script to configure the alpine repository for your version of alpine. 

  ```
  curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
  __NOTE__: Requires `bash` and `curl` to run:

  #### For Docker
  
  Add the following to your `Dockerfile` near the top.
  ```
  # Install the cloudposse alpine repository
  ADD https://apk.cloudposse.com/ops@cloudposse.com.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
  RUN echo "@cloudposse https://apk.cloudposse.com/3.11/vendor" >> /etc/apk/repositories
  ```
  __NOTE__: we support alpine `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, and `3.11` packages at this time

  ### Installing Alpine Packages
  
  When adding packages, we recommend using `apk add --update $package` to update the repository index before installing packages.
  
  Simply install any package as normal:
  ```
  apk add gomplate
  ```

  But we recommend that you use version pinning:
  ```
  apk add gomplate==3.0.0-r0
  ```

  And maybe even repository pinning, so you know that you get our versions:
  ```
  apk add gomplate@cloudposse==3.0.0-r0
  ```

  ### Makefile Interface
  
  The `Makefile` interface works on OSX and Linux. It's a great way to distribute binaries in an OS-agnostic way which does not depend on a package manager (e.g. no `brew` or `apt-get`). 
  
  This method is ideal for [local development environments](https://docs.cloudposse.com/local-dev-environments/) (which is how we use it) where you need the dependencies installed natively for your OS/architecture, such as installing a package on OSX.

  See all available packages:
  ```
  make -C install help
  ```

  Install everything...
  ```
  make -C install all
  ```

  Install specific packages:
  ```
  make -C install aws-vault chamber
  ```

  Install to a specific folder:
  ```
  make -C install aws-vault INSTALL_PATH=/usr/bin
  ```

  Uninstall a specific package
  ```
  make -C uninstall yq
  ```

  ### Docker Multi-stage Build

  Add this to a `Dockerfile` to install packages using a multi-stage build process:
  ```
  FROM cloudposse/packages:latest AS packages

  COPY --from=packages /packages/bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/
  ```

  ### Docker with Git Clone
  
  Or... add this to a `Dockerfile` to easily install packages on-demand:
  ```
  RUN git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git /packages && \
      rm -rf /packages/.git && \
      make -C /packages/install kubectl
  ```

  ### Makefile Inclusion

  Sometimes it's necessary to install some binary dependencies when building projects. For example, we frequently 
  rely on `gomplate` or `helm` to build chart packages.

  Here's a stub you can include into a `Makefile` to make it easier to install binary dependencies.

  ```
  export PACKAGES_VERSION ?= master
  export PACKAGES_PATH ?= packages/
  export INSTALL_PATH ?= $(PACKAGES_PATH)/bin

  ## Install packages
  packages/install:
          @if [ ! -d $(PACKAGES_PATH) ]; then \
            echo "Installing packages $(PACKAGES_VERSION)..."; \
            rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
            git clone --depth=1 -b $(PACKAGES_VERSION) https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
            rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH)/.git; \
          fi

  ## Install package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
  packages/install/%: packages/install
          @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/install $(subst packages/install/,,$@)

  ## Uninstall package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
  packages/uninstall/%:
          @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/uninstall $(subst packages/uninstall/,,$@)
  ```

  ### Contributing Additional Packages
  In addition to following the Contributing section, the following steps can be used to add new packages for review (via a PR).
  1. Clone an existing, similar, package within the vendors directory. Name the new folder with the same name as the binary package being installed.
  2. At a minimum, update the `VERSION`, `DESCRIPTION`, and `Makefile` to reflect the binary being installed. Ensure that a test task exist in the package Makefile.
  3. Test the install and ensure that it downloads and runs as expected (`make -C install <your_package> INSTALL_PATH=/tmp`)
  4. Test the apk build (see below)
  5. Update the `README.md` (`make init readme/deps readme`)

  ### Testing apk builds
  
  To validate that a new package will build into an apk you can use the following steps;

  ```bash
  make docker/build/apk/shell
  make -C vendor/<appname> apk
  # Some temp build files in the volume mount set user/group to nobody/nobody for apk building.
  # It is easier to remove them while within the docker container.
  rm -rf ./tmp/build.*
  exit
  ```
