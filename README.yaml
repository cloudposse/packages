    This repository is scheduled for archival. We recommend switching to the [Atmos Toolchain](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/toolchain/usage?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/packages&utm_content=deprecation-notice) for CLI tool management.

    Atmos provides native version-controlled tool management with support for 1,000+ tools from the Aqua registry.

    **What this means:**
    - We stop publishing new packages upon archival
    - Existing packages remain available on [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~cloudposse/repos/packages/packages/)
    - The exact archival date has not been determined
