# This file, VERSIONS-SKIP, is optional and rarely needed.
# It contains a list of versions to skip when updating
# the current version (auto-update), usually because there is
# something wrong with the release. Each version must be on a
# separate line with no leading or trailing spaces.
# Blank lines are ignored.
