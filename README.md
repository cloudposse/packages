## Deprecated

This repository is scheduled for archival. We recommend switching to the [Atmos Toolchain](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/toolchain/usage?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/packages&utm_content=deprecation-notice) for CLI tool management.

Atmos provides native version-controlled tool management with support for 1,000+ tools from the Aqua registry.

**What this means:**
- We stop publishing new packages upon archival
- Existing packages remain available on [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~cloudposse/repos/packages/packages/)
- The exact archival date has not been determined

**Learn more:**
- [Atmos Toolchain Usage](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/toolchain/usage?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/packages&utm_content=deprecation-notice)
- [Toolchain Management Changelog](https://atmos.tools/changelog/toolchain-management?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/packages&utm_content=deprecation-notice)

We literally have <a href="https://cpco.io/terraform-modules?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/packages&utm_content=terraform_modules">*hundreds of other terraform modules*</a> that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!
